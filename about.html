              Hey There! I'm Arthur Volfson 26 years old, Married and father to
              two adorable daughters. I was born in Belarus
              <b>(soviet union)</b> back in 1993. soon after my family and I
              moved to Israel. as a kid, I were always that kid that like to
              explore and learn how things works behind what we see in the
              internet browser. later on, at the beginning of my adult life my
              family and I were blessed to get the opportunity to relocate to
              the USA. once we landed here, I quickly learned that time is
              MONEY. and if I wanna live good, I gotta work hard for it. so I
              tried my luck bouncing around from job to job from position to
              position until that day when my dad introduced me to the Trucking
              world. Once again I was blessed to learn a skill that later helped
              to provide for me and my family. within couple years of hard work
              its finally started to feel like it was paying off. we BOUGHT our
              first house, me and my dad end up opening our own TRUCKING LLC
              (business). and my mom opened her own Beauty Salon that she always
              dreamed about. as we continued grow up as a business and a family
              I felt really bad for not being there for my wife and my kids.
              soon after I decided to step back from the trucking, and started
              to look up for programs / boot-camps that teach you how to build
              and develop your websites / Apps from ground up. after doing some
              research I chose and enrolled with DevMountain, which I spent a
              total of 13 Weeks of immersive training and successfully graduated
              around mid april of 2020. I'm currently available for job
              positions
